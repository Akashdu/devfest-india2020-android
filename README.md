## Goal  :dart:
The goal of the DevFest 2020 mobile track is to teach you Android development covering basics, intermediate, and advanced topics by creating a BookMyShow movie listing clone. The mobile track is divided into 3 levels
1. Beginner - Covering Android UI basics.
2. Intermediate - Covering Retrofit to make an API request to remote server and RecyclerView.
3. Expert - Covering MVVM architecture and Room Database for offline support.

In the end, you will get an app with a nice movie listing UI supporting offline access.


## How to use this repo to follow sessions? :technologist:

Repo has 3 branches beginner, intermediate, and expert. 
Day 1 starts with creating a fresh project and the beginner branch is a snapshot of that. The intermediate branch is a snapshot of the end of day 1. Day 2 starts from the intermediate branch and leads you to the expert branch. Finally, day 3 starts with the expert branch and leads you to the master branch.

So if you know the basics of android development and join us directly on day 2 checkout the intermediate branch and follow along. Similarly, if you are joining us directly on the day 3 checkout expert branch and follow along.
